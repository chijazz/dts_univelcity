# Assignment####
# from the finance file, I want us to deduce month by month, the difference(inc or dec) in income
# Determine the monthly income, then the monthly chnage in income and determine the month with the highest and lowest income 
# Write each company data into diff excel sheets

# Using the Agile Method
# use dictionaries as the most efficient 
# key : value
# using the month (key) : Amount (value)

# 1 Loop through all transactions
# 2 check date of each transactions (check corresponding month)
# 3 check amount of each transactions
# 4 convert month from numeric to text Value
# 5 dump value in a dictionary
